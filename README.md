Project Title: ColorizeNet - Image Colorization using Deep Learning

Project Overview:

ColorizeNet is a deep learning-based image colorization system that can automatically colorize grayscale images. The system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the mapping between grayscale images and their corresponding colorized versions.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Gather a large dataset of grayscale images and their corresponding colorized versions
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and normalize image data for training
3. Model Development: Train a CNN model using techniques like:
    - Encoder-Decoder architecture for image-to-image translation
    - Skip connections for preserving spatial information
    - Batch normalization for improved stability
4. Model Evaluation: Validate model performance using metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and color accuracy
5. Deployment: Deploy the model as a web or mobile application

Key Features:

1. Grayscale Input: Users can upload or capture grayscale images
2. Colorized Output: The system generates a colorized version of the input image
3. Customization Options: Users can adjust color palettes, saturation, and brightness
4. Real-time Processing: Colorization occurs in real-time, allowing for interactive editing

Deep Learning Techniques:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For image analysis and feature extraction
2. Encoder-Decoder Architecture: For image-to-image translation
3. Skip Connections: For preserving spatial information
4. Batch Normalization: For improved stability and performance
